# The Signature Verification Project

**The Signature Verification Project researches the verification of digital handwritten signatures on commonly used mobile devices.** 

As part of our work, we introduce two large, extensible databases and usability studies with over 10400 signatures by 73 participants, provide open-source scientific signature recording applications for two platforms, and propose a multi-staged processing toolchain and verification algorithm. With our research documented in the master’s thesis, we answer multiple open research questions in the following areas:

-	The viability of notebook touchpads as a signing platform
-	The value of additional hand-movement information obtained while signing on smartphones for verification performance
-	The comparative usability of signing on a notebook touchpad vs. signing on a smartphone

_This is the main repository for The Signature Verification Project. It provides an overview and contains the full-text thesis detailing our research and results, links to the repositories of each individual part of the project, and a download link and instructions for the signature database. **Currently, a scientific paper is in preparation that will also be made available here after its publication later this year (2022).**_

## Purpose

A person’s handwritten signature is a unique behavioral biometric trait that is legally and culturally accepted worldwide as proof of identity and consent. If we are able to reliably verify handwritten signatures on commonly used mobile devices such as smartphones and notebook touchpads, signatures have the potential to be used for authentication just like a fingerprint. This enables a wide variety of use cases, from simple unlocking mechanisms, over password-less logins with legal significance (eg. for banks, government administration, etc.) to secure handwritten document signing and much more.

## Overview

To learn more about our approach, our dataset, or our results, start with the masters thesis provided in this repository, which discusses every aspect in great detail.

To use our applications for your own research, please take a look at the repositories for the Android mobile recording app and the touchpad recording application, as well as our toolchain and verification algorithm implemented in python. All our applications are well documented and built to be easily use- and adaptable. Links are provided below.

To use our signature and/or usability datasets for your own research, please contact linus<dot>heimboeck<at>gmail<dot>com and briefly describe the goals and purpose of your project. If it is a non-profit project and your results will be made publicly available, we will happily give you access to any data you need.
